## Skills

We list all skills we think are helpful for the master in computer science program. The general skills will come in handy sooner or later. Course specific skills are less essential, but definitely useful for the listed courses.

Please keep in mind that this list was composed by students and it is in no way complete or binding. If you have suggestions for improvements, please let us know by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:joey.depauw@student.uantwerpen.be">joey.depauw@student.uantwerpen.be</a>.


### General Skills
__________________

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
During your master, you will have to complete various programming projects. In most courses you are allowed to use your preferred programming language, but it is advised to use Python, Java or C++ depending on the course. Using the advised language usually simplifies the project and enables for a more fluent collaboration. You should make sure you have a good understanding of object oriented programming.

#### Python
Python is a very popular language for prototyping and scripting. It has a minimal syntax and incoroprates both concepts from OOP and functional programming to make it an easy to learn and flexible language. It is used in most of the projects. The following interactive tutorial can help you get started: [www.learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org). It is especially good for students who already know OOP concepts.

#### LaTeX
LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech», is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

In your master it can prove useful for writing reports on projects as well as for writing your research internships/master thesis.

#### Git
Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It will make working on a project with other students a lot easier.

 - This tutorial will help you understand the basics of git.

 - You can also work with git through a GUI. We recommend gitkraken:

### Course Specific skills
__________________

#### State Automata
Some courses require prior knowledge of automata theory. Since it is taught as a first year bachelor course, it should be relatively simple to learn the basics for master students.

- <b>Software Engineering</b>
  - MDE - Model Driven Engineering
  - MoSIS - Modelling of Software Intensive Systems
  - S&V - Specification and Verification

- <b>Data Science</b>
  - /  

- <b>Computernetworks and Distributed Systems</b>
  - IPM - Introduction to Performance Modelling
  - APM - Advanced Performance Modelling

#### Regular expressions (Regex)
Regular expressions are strongly related to automata theory. Knowing what they are and how to work with them might come in handy later, and specifically for the courses listed below.

They are often used for recognizing textual patterns in an efficient way. We would recommend the following two websites:
 - <https://regexone.com/>
  - This website hosts an interactive tutorial for learning the basics of regular expressions. The explanations are short, clear and to the point. Every section is concluded with a small exercise. You can probably follow this tutorial in about an hour and have mastered the basics of using regular expressions.
 - <https://regex101.com/>
  - You can use this website to test and verify your regular expressions. It provides nice visualizations, support for examples to test your regex and even has a quick reference with search function in case you don't remember the syntax for something.

#### Matlab
MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python.

In short it's a programming language designed specifically for mathematical use cases. Some courses may use it.
