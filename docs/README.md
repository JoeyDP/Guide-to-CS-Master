## Skills

We list all skills we think are helpful for the master in computer science program. The general skills will come in handy sooner or later. Course specific skills are less essential, but definitely useful for the listed courses.

Please keep in mind that this list was composed by students and it is in no way complete or binding. If you have suggestions for improvements, please let us know by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:joey.depauw@student.uantwerpen.be">joey.depauw@student.uantwerpen.be</a>.


### General Skills
__________________

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
During your master, you will have to complete various programming projects. In most courses you are allowed to use your preferred programming language, but it is advised to use Python, Java or C++ depending on the course. Using the advised language usually simplifies the project and enables for a more fluent collaboration. You should make sure you have a good understanding of object oriented programming.

#### Python
Python is a very popular language for prototyping and scripting. It has a minimal syntax and incoroprates both concepts from OOP and functional programming to make it an easy to learn and flexible language. It is used in most of the projects. The following interactive tutorial can help you get started: [www.learnpython.org](www.learnpython.org). It is especially good for students who already know OOP concepts.

#### LaTeX
LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech», is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

In your master it can prove useful for writing reports on projects as well as for writing your research internships/master thesis.

#### Git
Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It will make working on a project with other students a lot easier.
